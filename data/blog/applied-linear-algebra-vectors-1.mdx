## About this series of articles

These posts are an introduction to applied linear algebra and the nim programming language.
The content is heavily based on two books [Introduction to Applied Linear Algebra](https://a.co/d/7qYJWKM) and [Linear Algebra Done Right](https://a.co/d/fW3lECH), both amazing books focusing 
on applications and theory respectively.

#### Motivation for the Nim programming language.

Nim is a great programming language for both general purpose programming and science. Unfortunately, its not very easy to find example or documentation for the language and its features, making
it difficult for early adopters to piece things together and get the job done. All code examples will be simple, uncluttered, and well documented along with alternatives for how to do things.

This post introduces the basics of the nim programming language and vectors needed for future posts on the series.


### Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed nim from instructions here: https://nim-lang.org/install.html . Also install `inim` which is a repl that you can run on your teminal/command line to quickly iterate 
on your programs here: https://github.com/inim-repl/INim.

If you ever need an environment to try out things without installing anything locally, try the nim playground: https://play.nim-lang.org/.


## About vectors

Vectors are a fundamental concept in linear algebra - which itself is a core requirement for doing sience. Vectors are ordered lists of numbers that are often used to describe things through listing out
their features.

There are various notations for vectors but we will use either square brackets or parentheseis as shown below:

$$
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  y_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  y_n
\end{array}\right]

\space
\space
\text{or}
\space
\space

\left(\begin{array}
  {c}
  y_1 \\
  . \\
  . \\
  . \\
  y_n
\end{array}\right)

$$

We this notation we can describe, many things such as house features prices, gps locations, colors, changes over time, and many more.

$$
\mathbf{coordinates} = \left(\begin{array}
  {c}
  3.0674 \\
  37.3556 \\
\end{array}\right)

\\
\\
\text{or}
\\
\\
\space
\\
\\

\mathbf{cyan} = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  0 \\
  100 \\
  100 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$

Where the first __element__ in the `coordinates` vector represent the latitude and the second represents 
the longitude; And the __elements__ in the `cyan` vector are the Red, Blue, and Green values respectiely.

Note: Elements can also be referred to as __coefficients__, __entries__, or __components__.

#### Vectors in nim
We can represent vectors using data structures that are capable of storing lists or sequences of numbers. 
In nim two great options are either the `array` or the `sequence` data type.

```nim
# This is an example of a comment. 
# All comments begin with the '#' symbol and are not excecuted by the computer

# Here we define the coordinates array.
# After the name of our array, we put a colon and define the type
# Here we state that the array has a length of 2 and contains 
# floating point numbers (numbers with decimals)
const coordinates: array[2, float] = [3.0674, 37.3556]

# The nim compiler is smart, we actually dont need to define the type everytime
# The compiler is smart enough determine the types from usage and context
# Here the compiler identifies the array as having the type array[2, float]
const other_coordinates = [5.0321, 22.943]

# We can print this out to the terminal through the `echo` command:
echo typeof other_coordinates
# Output -> array[0..1, float64] == type array[0..1, float64]
# We can see that the compiler correctly identified the array of float64 items 
# (we'll talk about float64, float32, and ints in another post)


# We can also define sequences. Which are similar to arrays, but with subtle difference
# This sequence does not have a defined size/length, and will contain integers 
# (numbers without decimals)
const cyan: seq[int] = @[0, 100, 100]

# Again we don't need to define the type every time. If the context is clear, 
# the compiler will know
const white = @[255, 255, 255]

# We can access an element of a vector using its `index`
# Here we will print out the 2nd element in the white vector (nim counting starts from 0)
echo white[1]
# Output -> 255
```
Note that mathematically, you refer to the second element like so: $$white_2$$. More generally $$a_i$$ gets the ith element of the a vector. 
Also observe that both arrays and sequences store items of the same datatype, you cannot have an array/sequence whose elements mix between types (int vs float vs string vs ...).

You will notice the use of the `const` keyword used to declare the vectors. We use `const` to define things that will never change, or get reassigned later on in the program. 
There 2 other ways of declaring things in nim: 
`let` and `var`.

```nim
# Strings and emojis work just as well 🎉!
const hobbies = ["swimming", "video games", "launching rockets 🚀"]

let subjects = ["mathematics", "physics", "art", "underwater basket weaving"]

var languages = ["nim", "julia", "python", "javascript", "rust"]
```
A special feature of `const`'s is that they are evaluated when the program is compiled and no extra work is 
needed during runtime - which can be great for perfomance is some cases. 
These are great for things that are known 
before hand. 

The `let` definitions also define things that will not change (like const) but not evaluated at compile time - 
which is great for things that do not change but are not known during development. The 
last keyword is `var`, used for things that can be reassigned (can change) during the runing of the program.

```nim
var languages = ["nim", "julia", "python", "javascript", "rust"]
echo languages # Output -> ["nim", "julia", "python", "javascript", "rust"]

languages = ["english", "french", "swahili", "mandarin", "spanish"]
echo languages # Output -> ["english", "french", "swahili", "mandarin", "spanish"]

# Note that we cannot reassign languages with another array of a smaller size
languages = ["english", "french"]
# 🐞 This will error out becuase arrays need to have a fixed size
```

```nim
# To support dynamic sizes, we should use sequences instead of arrays. i.e:
var languages = @["english", "french", "swahili", "mandarin", "spanish"]
languages = @["english", "spanish"]
# No errors here!
```

Additionally, since array sizes have to be known ahead of time, they can be stored directly on the stack 
while sequence has to be stored on the heap. Making the array more performant in some cases.
Learn more about Nim's memory model here: http://zevv.nl/nim-memory/

### Size
Vectors have a finite size _n_ - cannot contain an infinite number of elements. Many mathematicians can also refer to vectors as n-tuples. 
Nim also has the `tuple` data structure that _could_ be used for vector operations,
but we'll save that one for another time.

We can find the size of a vector using the `len` method:
```nim
const white = @[255, 255, 255]

# Print out its length
echo white.len()
# Output -> 2

# 🔥 Nim also supports Uniform Function Call Syntax
# Which you can read more about here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax
# basically means you can also do the following
echo len(white)
# Output -> 2
```

Coming from more mainstrem languages, I thought the Uniform Function Call Syntax was a downside to nim that would lead to confusion. 
This could not be further from the truth, I found that the syntax allows for very natural 
expression of intention and flexibility of thought. Also, its not something that can be easily explained, it should be experienced.

Since we are talking about (possibly) wierd things about nim, nim is case insensitive for variable names as long as the first characters match. i.e:
```nim
var coordinates = [0, 0, 0]

# Assign the second element the value 1.
# nim starts counting from 0, like many other languages
coordinates[1] = 1

# The following will fail because the first characters do not match
Coordinates[2] = 4
# 🐞 Error: undeclared identifier: 'Coordinates'

# Works just fine
# Underscores are also completely ignored!
coOrDi_nates[0] = 2

echo coordinates
# Output -> [2, 1, 0]
```

The last thing I'll say about the case-insensitivity and ignoring of underscores is that it was definitely a 
strange thing to get used to. However, its suprisingly refreshing in one regard, 
it forces you to *not* think about the code and syntax. You dont need to worry about the difference between 
the isEqual function and the is_equal function, because whichever one you use, 
you are checking whether things are equal.

### Vector Operations
In the next few paragraphs, we'll look at the basic operations: addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, inner (dot) products, and cross product vector operations.

#### Vector Addition
In vector addition we are simply adding each element of a vector to the element in the other vector at the same position.
$$
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  0 \\
  7 \\
\end{array}\right] + \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  1 \\
  2 \\
\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  1 \\
  9 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$

```nim
# Declare our two vectors
let vec1 = [0, 7]
let vec2 = [1, 2]

# declare the results array as a variable without a value
# we can set the size to 2 because we know adding 2 vectors of size 2, produces a vector of size 2
var result: array[2, int]

# Loop through the first vector
# We can access the index of each entry, and the entry itself
for index, entry in vec1:
  echo index, " : ", entry
  # At each index of the resuling vector, put the sum of the two entries of each vector
  result[index] = entry + vec2[index]

echo result
# Output -> [1, 9]
```


#### Vector Subtraction
Similar to vector addition, except the operation is now subtraction
$$
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  0 \\
  7 \\
\end{array}\right] - \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  1 \\
  2 \\
\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  -1 \\
  5 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$


```nim
# Declare our two vectors
let vec1 = [0, 7]
let vec2 = [1, 2]

var result: array[2, int]
for index, entry in vec1:
  echo index, " : ", entry
  # The only change between subtraction and addition
  # is the operation used - subtraction in this case
  result[index] = entry - vec2[index]

echo result
# Output -> [-1, 5]
```


#### Scalar Multiplication
Here we are multiplying a single value (scalar) by a vector. The result is equivalent to multiplying the scalar by each item 
of the vector - which results in a "scaled" version of the vector, hence the name scalar.
$$
\mathbf{(2)}\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  3 \\
  4 \\
  44.5 \\
\end{array}\right] = \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  6 \\
  8 \\
  89 \\
\end{array}\right]
$$


```nim
# Declare our two vectors
let scalar = 2.0
let vec = [3.0, 4.0, 44.5]

# This time our array will be of size 3 and type float
var result: array[3, float]

# In this case we only have one vector we can loop over. Much easier.
for index, entry in vec:
  result[index] = scalar * entry

echo result
# Output -> [6.0, 8.0, 89.0]
```


#### Inner (Dot) Product
One way to multiply two vectors with each other is by taking the inner product (also known as the dot product). This includes three steps: 
1. Transposing one of the vectors
2. Taking the product of its elements, one by one
3. Adding the results of the previous product operation

Resulting in *a single* value, which is the inner product of the two vectors.

Given two vectors, a and b, we can find the inner product:

$$
a^T b = a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_2 + ... + a_n b_n
$$

which is a scalar (a single number)

$$
\left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  -1 \\
  2 \\
  2 \\
\end{array}\right]^T  \left[\begin{array}
  {c}
  1 \\
  0 \\
  -3 \\
\end{array}\right] 
\\ 
\space
\\
= (-1)(1) + (2)(0) + (2)(-3) = -7 
$$

We will discuss the `transpose` operation in more detail in the future, but it basically means we convert the column vector into a row vector!

```nim
# Declare our vectors as usual
let vec1 = [-1, 2, 2]
let vec2 = [1, 0, -3]

# Initialize our result variable. Remember the compiler can infer types quite easily.
var result = 0
for index, entry in vec1:
  # Get the product of the entries at each index
  let prod = entry * vec2[index]
  # Add the product to the results
  result += prod


# Note: There are other ways to perform list comprehensions in Nim, 
# we'll cover them in the future.

echo result
# Output -> -7
```

#### Abstraction with Functions
In mathematics functions are everywhere, and everything can be expressed and described as a function. Without getting more philosophical, 
lets look at how we can describe things using functions:
```nim
# Functions can be defined using the `proc` keyword
# which can be thought of as a procedure
proc add(one: int, two: int): int =
  return one + two

# We can also use the `func` keyword
func subtract(one: int, two: int): int =
  return one - two

# Nim uses implicit returns, meaning in the absence of a return statement, 
# the last line is returned as the result
func product(one: int, two: int): int =
  one * two

# Nim functions also support overloading, you can define two functions with 
# the same name, but different properties and the 
# compiler will know which one you are referring to whenever you use the method.
func product(one: float, two: float, three: float): float =
  return one * two * three

# This is especially great when one operation/method can be used for different things.
```

The key difference between `proc` and `func` is that func's MUST be pure functions that do not have any side effects. i.e: 
You can `echo` (print) things to the console inside a proc but not inside a func. I like using func whenever I need to 
communicate that this function is pure, and can often be parallelized safely. The concept of pure functions is very interesting and I encourage everyone to dig deeper to 
understand how this helps create simpler software.

Using functions we can become more declarative by converting the imperative operations we have used before, into reusable operations:
```nim
# Because we know we want to support vector addition for vectors  
# of bot integers, and floats, and maybe other types like Natural numbers, etc,
# We can tell the compiler "We will pass in something of Type T" - and use the type
# T as a placeholder for operations I will perform later.
func add[T](vec1, vec2: T): T =
  ## Get the sum of two vectors
  var result: T 
  for index, entry in vec1:
    result[index] = entry + vec2[index]
  return result

echo add([1,2,3], [1,2,3])
# Output -> [2, 4, 6]
echo add([1.0,2.0,3.0], [1.0,2.0,3.0])
# Output -> [2.0, 4.0, 6.0]
# Both the integers and floats worked becuase we told the complier to figure it out.

func subtract[T](vec1, vec2: T): T =
  ## Subtract the second vector from the first one
  var result: T 
  for index, entry in vec1:
    result[index] = entry - vec2[index]
  return result

echo subtract([1,2,3], [1,2,3])
# Output -> [0, 0, 0]

# We can even have multiple placeholder types like below
func scalarVectorProduct[T, U](scalar: T, vec: U): U =
  ## Multiply a vector by a scalar
  var answer: U
  for index, entry in vec:
    answer[index] = scalar * entry 
  return answer

echo scalarVectorProduct(2, [1,2,3])
# Output -> [2, 4, 6]

# Here we need a placeholder type and we also need to tell the compiler
# that the second arguement will be a vector of some sort with elements of that type T.
# We can now use the `openArray` type which just means I am not sure what type of 
# vector it is, but it for sure is a vector (seq vs arr).
func dotProduct[T](vec1, vec2: openArray[T]): T =
  ## Get the inner product of two vectors
  var answer: T
  for index, entry in vec1:
    let prod = entry * vec2[index]
    answer += prod
  return answer

echo dotProduct([1,2,3],[1,2,3])
# Output -> 14
```

We can also overload the operators that come within nim:
```nim
# Here we are simply writing the same add function we have above.
# BUT we can now define our own operators using the `` syntax.
# ALSO, we are overloading the default "+" function by giving it new features
func `+`[T](vec1, vec2: T): T =
  var result: T
  for index, entry in vec1:
    result[index] = entry + vec2[index]
  return result

# We can now use the `+` operator like so:
echo [1,2,3] + [1,2,3]
# Output -> [2, 4, 6]

# We can do the same with the subtraction operator
func `-`[T](vec1, vec2: T): T =
  var result: T 
  for index, entry in vec1:
    result[index] = entry - vec2[index]
  return result

echo [1,2,3] - [1,2,3]
# Output -> [0, 0, 0]

# And the multiplication operator
func `*`[T, U](scalar: T, vec: U): U =
  var answer: U
  for index, entry in vec:
    answer[index] = scalar * entry 
  return answer

echo 2 * [1,2,3]
# Output -> [2, 4, 6]

# We can also define our own new operators like so:
func `*.`[T](vec1, vec2: openArray[T]): T =
  var answer: T
  for index, entry in vec1:
    let prod = entry * vec2[index]
    answer += prod
  return answer

# And use it as we wish
echo [1,2,3] *. [1,2,3]
# Output -> 14
```


### Wrapping up
In this post we have seen how to do the fundamental operations of linear algebra. We have also reviewed some features of the 
nim programming language which will be used for the rest of the series. In the next post we will look at linear functions while 
also familiarizing ourselves futher with the nim programming language.
