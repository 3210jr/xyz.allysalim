I build technology to help humans.

For technology to be useful and helpful to people, it must make the leap from "tool" to assistant and support system. I work with a fantastic partner and team to build artificially intelligent systems that support and help people. We tackle problems and inequities in healthcare and education.

I fail more often than I succeed, but, in that rare successful moment, I burst with joy and life. My biggest joys have always been in figuring our how things work and how they can be applied to solve problems.
